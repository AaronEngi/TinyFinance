== jGnash README

https://sourceforge.net/projects/jgnash/[jGnash] is a free (no strings attached!) personal finance manager with many
of the same features as commercially-available software. It was created in order to make tracking personal finances
easy, but also provides the functionality needed by advanced users. jGnash is cross-platform and will run on
any operating system that has a current Java Runtime Environment (e.g., Linux, Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows)

* jGnash requires *Java 11* (It can run on later versions. _See the <<Requirements, Requirements section.>>_)

* jGnash is compatible with the Oracle JVM as well as the open source OpenJDK Platform.

See the <<Requirements>> section below for more details.

To learn more about the features of jGnash, visit the https://sourceforge.net/projects/jgnash/[jGnash Website].

The jGnash download includes a user manual to help get you started with the basics if you are new to tracking finances.
It also covers some of the more subtle features, command line options, and shortcuts that are not immediately obvious.


[[jGnashFx-version]]
=== The Current Version: _jGnashFX_

The latest version of jGnash uses *JavaFX* for the user interface. This replaces the old versions that used Java Swing for the user interface.
This version is called "*jGnashFX*" to distinguish it from the older versions.  Experienced jGnash users will notice interface improvements.
For example, try using the vertical and horizontal scroll wheels in a date picker and the collapsible transaction forms.

The advantages of JavaFX over Swing are an improved appearance with better utilization of the systems graphics hardware
 including Hi-DPI systems. It also means a smaller code base for the user interface, access to better components such as improved
table support, HTML pages, functional animations, modern controls, etc.

[[Requirements]]
== Requirements

[[Reqs-Java]]
=== 1. Java 11 or newer: OpenJDK is recommended over use of Oracle JDK

==== Java 11

[[JDK-11]]
*Java 11 https://jdk.java.net/11/[JDK 11]* or later is required to run jGnash.

https://www.azul.com/downloads/zulu/[Azul OpenJDK 11] is a branded release that may be easier to install for some users.

==== OpenJDK or Oracle JDK

jGnash will work with either OpenJDK or Oracle JDK.  jGnashFx is tested using OpenJDK.  There are no noticeable differences in performance or
stability with the Oracle release or OpenJDK.

[[Reqs-OS]]
=== 2. Supported Operating Systems: Windows, Linux, or Mac OS X

==== Microsoft Windows

*  any version that can run the required version(s) of Java 11


==== Linux

* any version that can run the required version(s) of Java 11

Note: jGnash is _not compatible_ with the GCJ Java installation pre-installed on older Linux distributions.
You will need to install the *OpenJDK* or *Oracle Java* Platform and set the default for jGnash
to operate correctly.

==== Mac OS X

* Mac OS X 10.8.3 or later
* can run the required version(s) of Java 11

_Be sure to read <<Install-MacOSX, the section about installing on Mac OS X>> to create the startup script._


[[Download]]
== Download jGnash

You can download jGnash from the https://sourceforge.net/projects/jgnash/files/Active%20Stable%202.x/[jGnash Download Page].


[[Install]]
== To Install jGnash

. Install the latest version of *Java 8*  if you don't already have it installed.
Most users of jGnash will want to use the latest version of http://www.java.com/en/download/[Oracle Java Runtime Environment, version 8].
** If you use Java 9 or 10 you will need to do additional installation steps as specified in the <<JDK-9-10, Java 9 or 10 section.>>

** Developers will want the Java Development Kit (see build instructions below.)
. Unzip all files into a directory of your choice leaving the directory structure unchanged.


[[Install-MacOSX]]
=== Mac OS X Installation:

. Copy the jGnash folder to `/Applications` and remove the version so the final path looks like `/Applications/jGnash`.
. Create an AppleScript that will run the application:
.. Open the AppleScript Editor.

.. Create the following script:


    try
        do shell script "/Applications/jGnash/jGnashFx"
    end try


.. Save it as an Application called `jGnash.app` in `/Applications/jGnash`

. Instead of step 2,
 you can set the `/Applications/jGnash/jGnashFx` file to _Open with..._ `Terminal.app` (the Terminal application).


[[Running]]
== To Run:

Executable files are provided for Windows and UN*X users at the root of the installation directory. (These are `.bat` and `bash shell` files, respectively.)
Mac OS X users will have created application launch files per the <<Install-MacOSX, Mac installation instructions.>>
The `jGnashFx` executables will launch jGnash with the latest interface (jGnashFX). The `jGnash2` files will launch jGnash with
the old legacy Java Swing interface.

*Windows:*
Simply double click on the *.exe file of choice. (`jGnashFx.bat` is the current and preferred one.)

*UN*X:*  Start jGnash with one of the provided Bash scripts. (`jGnashFx` is the current and preferred one.)  If jGnash fails to launch, check your file permissions and
make sure they are set to be executable or use a unzip tool that preserves file permissions.

An example for UN*X users is shown below assuming you have changed to the installation directory:

[source]
----
./jGnashFx
----

*Mac OS X:*  Run the application file you created per the <<Install-MacOSX, Mac installation instructions.>>


[[Development]]
== Building and Development

Travis-CI Build Status image:https://travis-ci.org/ccavanaugh/jgnash.svg?branch=master["Build Status", link="https://travis-ci.org/ccavanaugh/jgnash"]


=== Development Tools

The IDE used for the development of jGnash is:

image:https://github.com/jGnash/jgnash.github.io/blob/master/img/logo_IntelliJIDEA.png["IntelliJIDEA Logo", height=90, link="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/"]


=== Building jGnash:

*Gradle* is used as the primary build system for jGnash.  The Gradle Wrapper is included (`gradlew` shell and .bat files) so that you do not need to
install Gradle.  The Wrapper will automatically download the necessary dependencies.

[NOTE]
Depending on your OS (almost always Windows and OSX) the JCE Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files for Java 8
are needed for the unit tests to complete correctly.  If you do not want to install these files or are
restricted by your locale, modify the test build or disable tests.  jGnash uses encryption for client / server
communication and unit tests are performed to prevent regressions.

To build jGnash you'll need the following software installed and correctly configured on your system:

. http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[JDK 8u71] or later.

If you are using JDK 9 or 10, you'll need to do <<Install-JDK-9-10, additional installation steps.>>

_If you are building with a recent 64 bit Linux system, you may need to enable Multilib/32 Bit support capabilities.
Otherwise, the Gradle build may fail when building the windows executables._

To create the distribution zip file, start at the main directory and run the gradle task to clean and create the distribution:

*Building on Windows:*

[source]
----
gradlew clean distZip
----

*Building on UN*X or Mac OS X:*

[source]
----
./gradlew clean distZip
----


This will run the gradle tasks necessary to run core tests and create the distribution file.  The distributable zip file will be produced at the root of the build directory called jGnash-_version_-bin.zip.
